    // You might think we can just do something like this:

    // however what happens when we update that array?


    // no hwere is the problem!


    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!


    // Why? It's because that is a n array reference, not an array coyp.
    // They both point to the same array!


    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // twice before using it.
